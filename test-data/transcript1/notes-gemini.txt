REASON FOR VISIT: Regular cleaning and checkup + cold sensitivity complaint

PATIENT HISTORY:

✓ Rest of mouth looks healthy

TREATMENT TODAY:
1. Deep cleaning with ultrasonic tool (patient noted vibration/buzzing sensation)
2. Polished teeth with fluoride paste to strengthen enamel
3. Showed proper flossing technique for problem areas

INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN:
- Use sensitivity toothpaste starting immediately
- No very cold drinks for 1 week
- Try water flosser for better cleaning around tooth #14
- Keep brushing well to prevent cavity from getting worse

NEXT APPOINTMENTS:
