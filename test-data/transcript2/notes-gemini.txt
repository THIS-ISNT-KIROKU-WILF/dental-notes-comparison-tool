DENTAL TREATMENT RECORD
Patient: Michael Chen | Date: March 20, 2025

PROBLEM: Severe tooth pain, lower right side

PATIENT COMPLAINT:
- Sharp pain when biting down (1 week duration, getting worse)
- Sensitive to hot drinks like coffee
- Pain affecting daily activities

DIAGNOSIS:
Big cavity in tooth #30 (back molar, bottom right). X-ray shows decay went into the deeper tooth layer but didn't reach the nerve yet - lucky!

TREATMENT COMPLETED:
âœ“ Gave numbing shot (lidocaine injection)
âœ“ Used drill to remove all the rotten part of tooth
âœ“ Cavity was bigger than expected but got it all out
âœ“ Filled with white composite material (applied in layers)
âœ“ Used blue light to harden each layer
âœ“ Adjusted bite - had to file down high spots so it felt normal

PATIENT EXPERIENCE:
- Handled injection well ("wasn't too bad")
- Completely numb during procedure
- Said bite felt "much better" after adjustments
- Very cooperative throughout

AFTER-CARE INSTRUCTIONS:
ðŸ”¸ Don't chew on right side for 2 hours until feeling comes back
ðŸ”¸ Brush gently for first day
ðŸ”¸ No hard/crunchy foods for a few days
ðŸ”¸ Call if pain continues after numbness goes away

OTHER NOTES:
- Noticed tartar buildup during exam - needs cleaning at next visit
- Filling should last 7-10 years with good care
- Patient relieved pain is gone

NEXT VISIT: 6 months for cleaning and checkup
